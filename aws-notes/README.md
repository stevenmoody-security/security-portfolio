# AWS Notes

This folder contains my structured technical notes from completing Adrian Cantrill’s **AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate (SAA)** course.  
The chapters are organized exactly according to the course curriculum and reflect the architectural domains required for real-world cloud engineering and security operations work.

These notes serve three purposes:

1. **Knowledge base** – concise, technically accurate explanations of core AWS services.  
2. **Portfolio artifact** – demonstrates cloud fundamentals, architectural thinking, and security awareness.  
3. **Revision resource** – structured in a way that supports exam preparation and long-term retention.

## 📘 Chapter Overview

Each file in this directory corresponds to a major section of the SAA curriculum:

1. **Chapter 1 – Fundamentals and Accounts**  
   Core account structures, IAM basics, MFA, and identity foundations.

2. **Chapter 2 – AWS Fundamentals**  
   Global infrastructure, VPC basics, EC2/S3 fundamentals, CloudFormation, CloudWatch, DNS, and availability concepts.

3. **Chapter 3 – IAM, Accounts, and AWS Organizations**  
   Policy mechanics, roles, permission boundaries, multi-account governance, and AWS audit/logging tools.

4. **Chapter 4 – S3 (Simple Storage Service)**  
   Security, encryption, storage classes, replication, lifecycle design, events, and data governance.

5. **Chapter 5 – VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**  
   Network design, subnet architecture, routing, IGW/NAT, security groups, NACLs, and foundational network security.

6. **Chapter 6 – EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**  
   Instance architecture, Nitro, instance families, EBS, instance store, AMIs, scaling strategies, purchase models, and metadata security.

7. **Chapter 7 – Containers, ECS, and EKS**  
   Container fundamentals, ECS (EC2/Fargate), ECR, Kubernetes concepts, and EKS architecture.

## 🧭 How to Use These Notes

- They are designed for **quick review** and deeper study — each section contains concise, exam-relevant explanations.  
- They intentionally emphasize **security, identity, networking, and operational behavior**, which are central to both cloud engineering and SOC/cloud analyst roles.  
- As I progress in my cloud specialization, I will expand these chapters with additional insights and practical examples.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository demonstrates:

- Systematic approach to cloud learning  
- Ability to break down complex systems into clear components  
- Understanding of AWS architectural patterns  
- Alignment with industry-recognized curriculum  
- Professional-level documentation practices  

These notes reflect my ongoing development toward roles in **cloud security**, **SOC analysis**, and **cloud infrastructure engineering**.
