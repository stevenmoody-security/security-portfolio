# Artifacts

This folder contains short, polished write-ups (“artifacts”) that demonstrate my ability to:
- Analyze AWS and security concepts,
- Communicate technical reasoning clearly,
- Summarize complex material into actionable insights.

Artifacts are not study notes — they are **portfolio pieces** designed to show how I think, investigate, and explain.  
Each artifact represents a real concept, threat scenario, or architecture pattern that I studied or analyzed.

## 📘 What You'll Find Here

- **ec2-metadata.md**  
  Analysis of EC2 Instance Metadata (IMDS), security implications, and SSRF/credential-theft threats.

- **encryption-key-management.md**  
  Breakdown of practical encryption strategies, key lifecycle considerations, and real-world trade-offs.

- **kill-chain-soc-summary.md**  
  A SOC-focused interpretation of the Cyber Kill Chain and how it guides investigation and prioritization.

As my training progresses, I will continue adding:
- Micro-investigations  
- SOC-style triage summaries  
- Architecture rationales  
- Cloud security decision artifacts  

## 🎯 Purpose

This folder reflects my ability to:
- Think critically about cloud security,
- Apply structured investigation workflows,
- Explain technical threats and mitigation strategies clearly.

Artifacts in this folder are designed to be **professional, concise, and highly readable**, making them useful for:
- Recruiters  
- Interview preparation  
- Mentorship sessions  
- Future reference
