# Labs

This folder contains hands-on lab work from multiple training environments, including AMU coursework, LetsDefend SOC simulations, and future AWS practical exercises.  
Labs are organized by **platform/source**, not by date, to clearly reflect the breadth of practical experience without implying beginner timelines or week-by-week progression.

Each lab demonstrates real operational skills — configuring security controls, triaging alerts, interpreting logs, and reasoning through security problems. These files are portfolio artifacts, not academic assignments.

## Directory Structure

- **amu/**  
  University course labs covering firewall rules, encryption, network security, and foundational security operations concepts.

- **letsdefend/**  
  SOC-focused practical work including SIEM alert triage, log investigations, endpoint analysis, and threat validation.

- **aws/** *(future)*  
  Hands-on AWS labs involving IAM, VPC, EC2, S3, container services, and cloud security architecture.

## What These Labs Demonstrate

- Ability to operate real security tools (firewalls, SIEM, EDR, log management).  
- Hands-on troubleshooting and investigation skills.  
- Understanding of network security enforcement (pfSense, routing, allow/deny logic).  
- Execution of encryption and data protection workflows.  
- Early-stage SOC reasoning (alert ownership, IOC scoping, endpoint triage).  
- Familiarity with security telemetry across multiple system types.

These skills directly support roles in **SOC analysis**, **cloud security**, and **incident response**.

## Purpose of This Directory

This folder reflects the *practical side* of my professional development:

- Where configurations break and I fix them  
- Where logs don’t match assumptions and I investigate  
- Where alerts require decisions, not just clicks  
- Where security controls demonstrate their real behavior  
- Where I build operational intuition  

The labs here show:

- **Technical execution**  
- **Debugging workflow**  
- **Understanding of security controls**  
- **Ability to reason about evidence**  
- **Growth over time across multiple platforms**

This directory will expand as I complete new SOC, AWS, and security engineering labs.
