# Labs

This folder contains hands-on lab summaries from my cloud and cybersecurity training.  
Each lab demonstrates practical skills — from firewall configuration to SIEM triage — and documents what I did, what I learned, and how I corrected mistakes.

These labs show operational competency, not just theory.

## What You'll Find Here

- **week-1-labs-summary.md**  
  Summary of pfSense firewall configuration, AMU encryption lab, and LetsDefend SOC Fundamentals hands-on work.

As additional labs are completed, this folder will include:
- Firewall and network configuration labs  
- AWS hands-on building exercises  
- SOC alert analysis walkthroughs  
- Encryption, IAM, and logging labs  
- Threat detection and response scenarios  

## Why These Labs Matter

Hands-on labs demonstrate:
- The ability to *operate* cloud and security tools, not just read about them  
- Troubleshooting skills under time pressure  
- Familiarity with real SOC platforms (SIEM, Log Management, EDR)  
- Comfort working inside AWS environments (networking, EC2, IAM, S3, etc.)  

They provide concrete evidence of progress toward cloud security and SOC analyst roles.

## Purpose

This folder represents the practical side of my training — the part where mistakes happen, configurations break, logs don’t match expectations, and I work through them.

The labs here show:
- Technical execution  
- Debugging workflow  
- Understanding of security controls  
- Growth over time
