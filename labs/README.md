# Labs

This folder contains hands-on lab work from multiple training environments, including AMU coursework, LetsDefend SOC simulations, and future AWS practical exercises.  
Labs are organized by **platform/source**, not by date, to clearly reflect the breadth of practical experience without implying beginner timelines or week-by-week progression.

Each lab demonstrates real operational skills — configuring security controls, triaging alerts, interpreting logs, and reasoning through security problems. These files are portfolio artifacts, not academic assignments.

---

## Directory Structure

- **amu/**  
  University course labs covering firewall rules, encryption, network security, and foundational security operations concepts.

- **letsdefend/**  
  SOC-focused practical work including SIEM alert triage, log investigations, endpoint analysis, and threat validation.

- **aws/** *(future)*  
  Hands-on AWS labs involving IAM, VPC, EC2, S3, container services, and cloud security architecture.

---

## What These Labs Demonstrate

- Ability to operate real security tools (firewalls, SIEM, EDR, log management).  
- Hands-on troubleshooting and investigation skills.  
- Understanding of network security enforcement (pfSense, routing, allow/deny logic).  
- Execution of encryption and data protection workflows.  
- Early-stage SOC reasoning (alert ownership, IOC scoping, endpoint triage).  
- Familiarity with security telemetry across multiple system types.

These skills directly support roles in **SOC analysis**, **cloud security**, and **incident response**.

## Purpose of This Directory

This folder reflects the *practical side* of my professional development:

- Where configurations break and I fix them  
- Where logs don’t match assumptions and I investigate  
- Where alerts require decisions, not just clicks  
- Where security controls demonstrate their real behavior  
- Where I build operational intuition  

The labs here show:

- **Technical execution**  
- **Debugging workflow**  
- **Understanding of security controls**  
- **Ability to reason about evidence**  
- **Growth over time across multiple platforms**

## Skills Demonstrated

This portfolio highlights the technical skills I am actively developing for cloud security and SOC analyst roles:

### **Cloud Architecture & AWS**
- IAM, roles, least-privilege design  
- VPC segmentation, routing, NAT, SG/NACL enforcement  
- EC2 architecture, scaling, metadata security  
- S3 permissions, lifecycle, encryption, access patterns  
- Container fundamentals (ECS, ECR, EKS, Kubernetes basics)

### **Security Operations & Incident Analysis**
- SIEM alert triage and prioritization  
- Log investigation across proxy, firewall, endpoint, and cloud sources  
- Endpoint detection & response (EDR) analysis  
- IOC scoping and threat validation  
- Triage workflow: trigger → evidence → hypothesis → decision

### **Network & Host Security**
- Firewall rule creation and troubleshooting (pfSense)  
- Understanding of allow/deny order, stateless vs stateful controls  
- Identifying abnormal traffic patterns and suspicious behaviors  
- Basic malware and persistence behavior awareness

### **Encryption & Key Management**
- Data confidentiality vs integrity  
- Encryption impact on system performance  
- Key lifecycle: creation, rotation, backup, destruction  
- AWS KMS concepts mirrored in academic labs

### **Technical Communication & Documentation**
- Clear, concise security write-ups  
- Professional incident-style investigations  
- Organized note systems reflecting architectural reasoning  
- Ability to explain complex topics to technical and nontechnical audiences  

These skills reflect real operational workflows and map directly to early-career SOC, cloud analyst, and cloud security engineering roles.

This directory will expand as I complete new SOC, AWS, and security engineering labs.
