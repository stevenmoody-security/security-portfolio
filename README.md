# Steven Moody — Security Learning Portfolio

This repository showcases my technical development in **cloud security**, **SOC analysis**, and **incident investigation** as I transition from the U.S. Army into a cybersecurity career.  
It contains structured AWS architecture notes, hands-on labs, incident-style investigations, and technical artifacts that demonstrate how I think and how I solve security problems.

The focus of this portfolio is not memorization, but **operational reasoning** — the ability to analyze evidence, apply security principles, and communicate findings clearly.

## 📂 Repository Structure

### **/aws-notes/**
Structured, chapter-based notes following Adrian Cantrill’s AWS SAA curriculum.  
These files demonstrate cloud fundamentals, architectural understanding, and security-aware thinking across IAM, VPC, EC2, S3, containers, and Kubernetes.

### **/artifacts/**
Short, polished write-ups (5–15 sentences) explaining complex concepts such as:
- EC2 metadata & SSRF risks  
- Encryption and key management  
- Cyber Kill Chain from a SOC perspective  
These serve as high-signal technical writing samples.

### **/investigations/**
Incident-style analyses of simulated alerts and cloud security scenarios.  
Each investigation uses a structured process (trigger → evidence → hypothesis → decision → recommendations).  
Demonstrates practical SOC triage, threat reasoning, and defensive mindset.

### **/labs/**
Hands-on work from multiple platforms:
- **AMU** – firewall configuration, encryption labs  
- **LetsDefend** – SIEM, EDR, and log investigations  
- **AWS** – cloud configuration labs (future)  
Shows practical skill execution, troubleshooting, and understanding of real security controls.

## 🎯 What This Portfolio Demonstrates

This repository reflects key competencies aligned with SOC and cloud security roles:

- **Alert triage** using SIEM, logs, and EDR  
- **AWS architecture and security fundamentals**  
- **Identity, access, and metadata security analysis**  
- **Network security concepts (firewalls, routing, ACLs)**  
- **Threat modeling and Kill Chain reasoning**  
- **Clear, concise technical communication**  
- **Hands-on troubleshooting under pressure**  

Every file exists to highlight applied understanding — not academic theory.

## 🔍 Purpose

My goal is to build a career in **cloud security engineering** or **SOC/cloud analyst roles**.  
This portfolio provides a transparent view of my technical progress, showing how I reason through problems, break down systems, and translate concepts into actionable knowledge.

As I gain more experience, this repository will evolve with deeper investigations, more AWS labs, and security engineering artifacts.
