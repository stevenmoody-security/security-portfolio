# Steven Moody — Security Learning Portfolio

This repository documents my progression toward a SOC Analyst and Cloud Security career.  
It contains hands-on investigations, cloud security notes, detection logic, and technical artifacts 
produced while studying AWS, threat analysis, security operations, and labs.

## Structure (current and planned)

- /artifacts – 5–7 sentence technical briefs on key security concepts
- /investigations – incident-style analysis of simulated security alerts

More folders (aws-notes, soc-notes, labs) will be added as I complete additional work.
